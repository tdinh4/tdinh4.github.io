I'm a second year undergraduate student currently studying at UCLA. I'm majoring in computer science while also pursuing a minor in Bioinformatics. I've had two research internships in my career, one at Boston University and one at the U.S Naval Research Laboratory in Washington D.C.

I'm passionate about applying my knowledge of computer science and machine learning to areas in healthcare where we can really engineer better solutions for helping doctors and taking care of patients. 

For information about side projects I've done (neural nets, sports, APIs, etc), check out my <a href="https://github.com/adeshpande3"  target="_blank">github</a>.

Actively looking for an internship in the summer of 2017.
